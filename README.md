Website contains Login and Sign Up page and Admin Grid Page.

Sign Up: This page Contains the fields like Name, Last Name, Email, Password and Confirm Paswword. Once they click on Register button their details will be stored in the Database through xampp server phpMyAdmin.

Login: In this page the user must provide the valid credentials in order to login to his/her account. Its Functionaliy is to check whether the credentials provided by user is matching to the database. If yes the user will be loged-in successfuly which redirects him to the Home Page of Application. If the User credentials doesnt match a message with "Login Unsuccesfull. Please sign up before you login." On clicking ok it redirects the page to sign up form.
